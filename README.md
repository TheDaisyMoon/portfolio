# portfolio
working on my portfolio here, trying to keep track of what I did and what I have to do. 

# What I did (for now) :
This is the 3rd version and it has to be the last one (for now at least).
I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
I did some things in Javascript. 

# What I have to do :
- Make it accessible.
- Complete the content
- The whole design
- probably add some visual elements
- Reorganize the css
- Create a logo ???
- Find fonts that I actually really like. 
- Debug the weird stuff it does when it has to be responsive. 
- Find other ways to make it fun (like the quote generator). 
- Upload it on my domain to be able to link the result here. 


I'm a newbie at coding so it's pretty basic. Suggestions/tips would be life saving !
