# portfolio
working on my portfolio here, trying to keep track of what I did and what I have to do. 

# What I did (for now) :
Used HTML and CSS for that first version. Also used Bootstrap because we had to at my bootcamp, but not sure if I'll keep it. I also had fun with some animations, which probably won't stay. I'm pretty happy with the colors I used, but will be trying something else, this is not quite what I want.

# What I have to do :
- Make it accessible.
- Complete the content
- Change the colors to try something else
- add my cv
- probably change the bootstrap elements
- probably add some visual elements


I'm a newbie at coding so it's pretty basic. Suggestions/tips would be life saving !
